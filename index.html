  <h1>Professional Self-Assessment</h1>
  <p>Over the course of the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University, I have developed a wide range of skills in software engineering, algorithms, data structures, databases, and cybersecurity. This ePortfolio showcases my progress through selected enhanced artifacts that represent my technical growth and readiness for a career in the field.</p>

  <p>Throughout the program, I completed coursework that emphasized collaboration, communication, and problem-solving. Working on team projects and receiving feedback helped me develop a professional mindset and adapt to real-world development environments. I learned to collaborate through GitHub, provide and receive peer reviews, and write clear documentation for users and fellow developers.</p>

  <p>Iâ€™ve improved my ability to design efficient algorithms, apply object-oriented principles in software design, and create secure, data-driven web applications. For example, I enhanced an earlier C++ project to improve time complexity and secure input handling, which is now part of this portfolio. I also expanded a full-stack travel web app by integrating MongoDB with Node.js and Angular, demonstrating my knowledge of database systems and modern web development practices.</p>

  <p>Security has been a consistent focus throughout the program. From writing input validation logic to avoiding buffer overflows in C++, Iâ€™ve adopted a mindset that prioritizes safety and privacy in design decisions. This will continue to guide my work in any professional setting.</p>

  <p>The artifacts in this portfolio demonstrate my ability to solve complex problems, build scalable applications, and work professionally in software development. My goal is to pursue a career in cybersecurity or full-stack development, and this portfolio reflects the skills and mindset I bring to the table.</p>
